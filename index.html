        <p>
          The business you own is something you wake up thinking about, and the
          issues of the day linger in your mind way past closing time. Whether
          your business is properly insured may be one of those issues, and if
          so, we'd like to help. Globalgreen Insurance Agency works with several
          carriers to offer you insurance coverage to put your mind at ease.
          There are many different options, and we can combine those that are
          the most appropriate for your specific kind of business so that you
          will be covered for potential problems that are of the most concern to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A business owner's policy, also known as a BOP, might be the perfect
          solution for coverage. If you have fewer than 100 employees and less
          than $5 million in annual sales plus property or equipment you want to
          protect, a BOP is worth exploring. To begin with, you'll be covered
          for property damage and general liability. It might be wise to add
          crime insurance to protect your business against fraud or theft, and
          equipment breakdown insurance which covers mechanical and electrical
          equipment as well as your computers. Speaking of computers, you might
          also want to add cyber liability insurance, which is great to have if
          someone hacks your computers and your electronic data is compromised.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know how hard you work to keep your customers happy and your
          company running on an even keel. When you're ready to talk about
          insurance protection, just give Globalgreen Insurance Agency a call at

          thing you have to think about when you wake up in the morning.

        <h2 class="top-padding-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Are They Independent Insurance Agents OR Captive Agents?</h3>
        <p>
          What is the difference? Independent agents aren't tied to any specific
          insurance company. An independent agent can shop around and find you
          the best rate with different insurance companies (The Hartford, Geico,
          State Farm, etc.). A captive agent—or direct agent—works for a
          specific insurance company and can only offer you policies and rates
          directly through that company. A third option is to work with an
          insurance broker. Insurance brokers act as an independent agent that
          is loyal to you as the customer. They often charge a percentage of the
          policy rate (15% is common) as the fee to work with them.
        </p>
        <h3>Can You Get a Referral?</h3>
        <p>
          Check with other local small business owners, family, and friends. Do
          they have a particular agent or broker that they’ve worked with? Are
          there insurance professionals they would recommend who have expertise
          in the field you're in? Getting a referral from someone you trust is a
          great way to connect with a trustworthy agent.
        </p>
        <h3>What Type of Insurance Coverages Do They Offer?</h3>
        <p>
          Even if you're referred to a great agent with solid credentials, you
          need to be sure they offer the types of policies that you need. Some
          insurance companies or independent agents don’t work in every
          insurance niche. For example, if you’re a general contractor, you need
          an inland marine insurance policy to protect your tools and equipment
          while in transit or stored at a job site. If your insurance
          agent/insurance company doesn’t offer coverage options you need, you
          may need to shop around for a different insurance agency. While that
          is just one example, you need to do some research in advance to be
          familiar with the type of insurance policy or policies you may need.
        </p>
        <h3>Is the Insurance Agent an Expert in Your Industry?</h3>
        <p>
          Has your agent shown a level of expertise about your industry? Are
          they able to show familiarity with your industry and make
          recommendations specific to it? It’s wonderful if you find an agent
          that has the right licenses and great referrals—but they need to know
          your business. If you choose to work with younger or inexperienced
          insurance agents to give them a change to grow in their expertise,
          it’s commendable. You have to be clear that you’re fine if they don’t
          have an answer on specific questions you may have and give them time
          to get more information. But if you’re looking for an insurance
          expert, make sure you ask them pertinent questions about your industry
          to gauge their level of expertise and knowledge.
        </p>
        <h3>Can You Interview Them?</h3>
        <p>
          It’s important that you can have a conversation with the agent or
          broker that you’re planning on working with. Will they make time in
          their schedule to answer any question you may have? Will they explain
          the different insurance options available to you? Are they trying to
          hard sell you on one particular policy? You can often get a feel for
          someone in a simple conversation.
        </p>
        <h3>Ask Them For a Quote</h3>
        <p>
          One of the best ways to gauge the expertise and professionalism of an
          agent is their quote process. Have they reviewed several options to
          meet your insurance needs? Will they explain the different policy
          options, including price and coverage differences? A smooth process
          can be an indicator of future results. It's an integral part of the
          process that needs to go well.
        </p>
        <h3>Do They Handle Claims?</h3>
        <p>
          Most agents that work with larger insurance companies (or even
          independently) don’t handle claims processing or adjusting. However,
          they should be able to articulate what the claims process looks like,
          how to contact their claims department, file a claim, etc. If they
          can’t walk you through the process, who do you turn to when you need
          to file a claim? What if you file it incorrectly and lose out on
          thousands of dollars? Make sure you choose an agent that doesn’t leave
          you hanging when you need them the most.
        </p>
        <h3>Do You Like Them?</h3>
        <p>
          While most people don’t find this necessary in business relationships,
          it can be an important factor when considering a long-term
          relationship. Most people like to work with someone they like and
          someone they trust. Do you feel that this agent is honest and
          trustworthy? Does your agent ask questions about your company? Does
          the independent agent or broker care and/or is genuinely interested in
          your company and not just the commission?
        </p>
        <h3>Request an Annual Review</h3>
        <p>
          Once you land on an insurance agent or a broker, we suggest setting up
          an annual review either face-to-face, by a dedicated phone call, or a
          virtual meeting. An annual review is not “Here are the latest
          premiums—sign here.” Instead, you should expect a thorough review of
          what’s changed (new equipment, new employees, new locations and
          expansion planning, new product offerings, etc.) This information is
          critical to them to help make sure you have the right amount of
          insurance coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set your expectations of what you want from your commercial agent and
          then get agreement when moving forward. Your commercial agent must be
          a trusted advisor who has some understanding of your business and the
          risk involved in running it.
        </p>
        <h3>When to Consider Changing Your Insurance Provider</h3>
        <p>
          In what instances should you start shopping around for a different
          insurance company? Here are some things to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You get slow or no response to questions and requests</li>
          <li>The agent doesn't clearly explain the renewal process</li>
          <li>They don't have knowledge or expertise in your field</li>
          <li>They won’t shop around for better quotes for you</li>
          <li>They can't explain how to deal with a loss/file a claim</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are just a few things to consider when choosing an insurer to
          work with. There are a lot of choices out there and we know the
          decision can be daunting. If you have any other questions about
          choosing an independent agent, feel free to give us a call at
